@brief  The key derivation function is as specified in the "KDF in Counter Mode" section of
    NIST Special Publication 800-108: Recommendation for Key Derivation Using Pseudorandom Functions.
    Key derivation is based on length l, label L, context C and derivation key Ki.
        AES-CMAC is used as the pseudorandom function (PRF).
\note   When using this API the label and context for each use-case must be well defined.
\note   We recommend to derive only 256-bit keys from HUK or 256-bit user keys.

@return CC_OK on success.

@brief This API allows a limited AES-CCM decrypt and verify operation, needed for AES-CCM verification during boot.
AES-CCM combines counter mode encryption with CBC-MAC authentication.
Input to CCM includes the following elements:
<ul><li> Payload - text data that is both decrypted and verified.</li>
<li> Associated data (Adata) - data that is authenticated but not encrypted, e.g., a header.</li>
<li> Nonce - A unique value that is assigned to the payload and the associated data.</li></ul>
